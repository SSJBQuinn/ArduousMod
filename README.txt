"The moment man devoured the fruit of knowledge, he sealed his fate...
Entrusting his future to the cards, man clings to a dim hope.
Yet, the Arcana is the means by which all is revealed...
Beyond the journey you have taken lies the absolute end.
It matters not who you are... One thing is always certain: Death awaits all."
